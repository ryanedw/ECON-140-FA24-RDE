That would mean that out of the [334 million resident population in the U.S. on January 1, 2023](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/12/happy-new-year-2023.html), a straight 5% sample would select 5 out of every 100 people at random, for a total of 16.7 million people. This kind of design is found in the public-use version of the 1980 Census in IPUMS, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "But modern surveys usually have a more complex design, because one would like to have statistical power to understand key subgroups. The share of people in the U.S. who identify as Black or African-American was [13.6% in 2022](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045222). Not all population subgroup is <i>oversampled</i>, meaning included at higher rates than non-Hispanic white people, but many are. This is done in order to facilitate analysis of well-being among those subgroups. \n",

    "But <b>sampling weights might not change the results of OLS very much</b>, if the regression already controls for demographic variables like age, gender, and race/ethnicity. The reason is that the sampling weights are usually functions of those demographic variables, so estimating OLS with sample weights might be redundant."
